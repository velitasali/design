This site serves the purpose of creating a design language that stays consistent across 
different websites. 

After experimenting with different design types, my main focus when designing websites
shifted to:

* Spacing
* Coloring
* Shaping
* Typography

When any of these stands out more than the others, the design seems off and that part 
of the design sticks out like a sore thumb. 

As someone who is not a designer, I felt like messages I was tring to convey was being
lost due to the bad communication channel that the design establishes. 

To fix the issue, I spent a lot of time making micro-adjustments that didn't fix anything, 
as I was failing to address the main issue: establishing consistency. You can think of it like
this: if the font is playful meanwhile the rest of the design language radiates a serious 
tone, that design is inconsistent.
